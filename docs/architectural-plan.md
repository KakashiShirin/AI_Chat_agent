Of course. As the `architect`, I have synthesized our entire discussion into a comprehensive technical blueprint and development plan for the AI Data Agent MVP. This document will serve as the guide for the development team.

Here is the full-scale plan.

-----

### **Project Plan: AI Data Agent MVP**

#### **1. Project Vision & Goals**

To create a conversational platform that empowers non-technical users to gain insights from their data. Users can upload files (Excel, CSV) and ask complex business questions in natural language, receiving answers with relevant charts and tables.

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core functionality: file ingestion, natural language querying, robust data analysis, and result visualization for a single user session.

#### **2. Core Features & Requirements**

**User Stories:**

  * As a user, I want to upload a multi-sheet Excel or CSV file containing various data so that I can centralize it for analysis.
  * As a user, I want to ask complex questions in natural language (e.g., "what were the most purchased products in 2019?") so that I can gain insights without writing code.
  * As a user, I want to ask follow-up questions to my previous queries so that I can delve deeper into the data.
  * As a user, I want to receive answers as a combination of text analysis and visualizations (graphs) so that I can easily understand the findings.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

  * **Data Agnosticism:** The system must be able to analyze any type of tabular data (e.g., business, inventory, crime data) without being domain-specific.
  * **Data Resilience:** The platform must be engineered to gracefully handle common data quality issues, including broken/erroneous data, mismatched data types, and inconsistent formatting.

#### **3. System Architecture**

The system will be built using a service-oriented architecture, ideal for scalability and maintainability.

  * **React Frontend:** A Single-Page Application (SPA) that handles all user interaction, file uploads, and rendering of chat messages and charts (using a library like `Recharts` or `Chart.js`).
  * **Backend API Gateway (Python/FastAPI):** The central entry point for the frontend. It will manage user sessions, handle API requests, and route them to the appropriate backend services.
  * **Data Processing Service (Python):** This service activates upon file upload. It is responsible for ingesting, cleaning, standardizing, and structuring the data from user files into a queryable format in the database.
  * **AI Agent Service (Python):** The core intelligence. It receives natural language queries, orchestrates the generation and execution of analysis code, and synthesizes the final response.

#### **4. AI Agent: Detailed Design**

The AI Agent will use a **hybrid, agentic approach**, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for code generation rather than direct answering.

  * **Platform:** **Hugging Face Inference API**. This provides access to powerful, open-source models as a free-to-use API service, keeping our Vercel deployment lightweight and within free-tier limits.
  * **Recommended Models:**
      * `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`
      * `codellama/CodeLlama-34b-Instruct-hf`
  * **Execution Flow:**
    1.  **Schema Extraction:** The service retrieves the table schema (column names, data types) for the user's uploaded data from the PostgreSQL database.
    2.  **Prompt Construction:** It constructs a detailed prompt containing the user's question, the data schema, and a clear instruction for the LLM to generate a Python script using the Pandas library to find the answer.
    3.  **API Call:** The prompt is sent to the chosen model via the Hugging Face Inference API.
    4.  **Safe Code Execution:** The LLM's response (a string of Python code) is received. This code is **never executed directly**. It is run within a secure, sandboxed environment to analyze the data loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
    5.  **Result Synthesis:** The output from the executed code is captured. This raw data, along with the original question, is sent in a final API call to the LLM, asking it to generate a user-friendly, natural language summary and suggest an appropriate chart type.

#### **5. Technology Stack Summary**

  * **Frontend:** React
  * **Backend:** Python (using FastAPI)
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL (via a free-tier provider like Neon)
  * **AI/LLM:** Hugging Face Inference API
  * **Deployment:** Vercel

#### **6. MVP Development Roadmap**

This roadmap is broken into distinct, sequential phases.

  * **Phase 1: Backend Foundation & Data Pipeline**

      * **Goal:** Establish the core data handling capabilities.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Set up the FastAPI project structure.
        2.  Implement the file upload endpoint on the API Gateway.
        3.  Build the Data Processing Service:
              * Use `pandas` to read Excel/CSV files.
              * Implement basic data cleaning logic (handle missing values, infer data types).
              * Set up the PostgreSQL database schema.
              * Write logic to save the cleaned DataFrame into a SQL table.
        4.  Create a simple "health check" endpoint to verify the service is running.

  * **Phase 2: AI Agent Service & Core Logic**

      * **Goal:** Build the intelligent core of the application.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Create the AI Agent Service module.
        2.  Implement the logic to fetch a table's schema.
        3.  Write the prompt-generation function.
        4.  Integrate the Hugging Face Inference API client.
        5.  Set up a secure, sandboxed environment for Python code execution.
        6.  Implement the full execution flow: `prompt -> generate code -> execute code -> synthesize result`.
        7.  Create an endpoint on the API Gateway to receive a user query and return the AI's analysis.

  * **Phase 3: Frontend Interface & Integration**

      * **Goal:** Create the user-facing application and connect it to the backend.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Set up a basic React application using `create-react-app` or `Vite`.
        2.  Build the UI components: file upload button, chat window, and input bar.
        3.  Implement state management for the conversation history.
        4.  Connect the file upload component to the backend endpoint.
        5.  Connect the chat input to the AI Agent query endpoint.
        6.  Render the text responses from the AI Agent in the chat window.
        7.  Integrate a charting library and render basic visualizations based on the AI's suggestions.

  * **Phase 4: Deployment & Testing**

      * **Goal:** Deploy the MVP and conduct end-to-end testing.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Configure the project for deployment on Vercel.
        2.  Set up environment variables for the database connection and Hugging Face API key.
        3.  Deploy the application.
        4.  Conduct end-to-end testing with various sample Excel files (including messy ones) to validate the full workflow.

This concludes the architectural plan. We have a clear vision, a robust and scalable design, and an actionable roadmap. The next step is to move this plan to your development environment and begin with Phase 1.
