Understood. That's a smart choice for an MVP, keeping costs down while using a powerful and widely-supported database like PostgreSQL.

I will finalize the **Technical Requirements** with this information.

### Project Brief: Complete

Excellent work. As the `analyst`, my role is now complete. We have successfully collaborated to create a comprehensive Project Brief. Here is a summary of what we've defined:

* **Project Vision:** To create a conversational platform empowering non-technical users to analyze complex data from various file types using natural language, receiving insights through text and visualizations.
* **User Stories:**
    * Upload single or multiple files (Excel, CSV, etc.) to a session.
    * Ask complex, natural language questions about the data.
    * Receive answers with text analysis and relevant charts.
    * Ask follow-up questions within a persistent conversation.
    * Manage multiple chat sessions for different analyses.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    * **Data Agnosticism:** The system must be able to analyze any type of tabular data without being tied to a specific domain.
    * **Data Resilience:** The system must gracefully handle messy, incomplete, and poorly formatted data.
* **Technical Stack:**
    * **Frontend:** React
    * **Backend:** Python
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL (using a free-tier provider like Neon, compatible with Vercel)
    * **Deployment:** Vercel

### Next Step: `*agent architect`

Our foundation is solid. The next step in the `backend-api` workflow is to transition to the `*agent architect`.

I will now transform into the **`architect`**. My responsibility is to take this Project Brief and design the high-level system architecture. This will include defining the API structure, data models, and the core components of the AI agent.

Are you ready to begin designing the architecture?
