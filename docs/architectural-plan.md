Of course. As the `architect`, I have synthesized our entire discussion into a comprehensive technical blueprint and development plan for the AI Data Agent MVP. This document will serve as the guide for the development team.

Here is the full-scale plan.

-----

### **Project Plan: AI Data Agent MVP**

#### **1. Project Vision & Goals**

To create a conversational platform that empowers non-technical users to gain insights from their data. Users can upload files (Excel, CSV) and ask complex business questions in natural language, receiving answers with relevant charts and tables.

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core functionality: file ingestion, natural language querying, robust data analysis, and result visualization for a single user session.

#### **2. Core Features & Requirements**

**User Stories:**

  * As a user, I want to upload a multi-sheet Excel or CSV file containing various data so that I can centralize it for analysis.
  * As a user, I want to ask complex questions in natural language (e.g., "what were the most purchased products in 2019?") so that I can gain insights without writing code.
  * As a user, I want to ask follow-up questions to my previous queries so that I can delve deeper into the data.
  * As a user, I want to receive answers as a combination of text analysis and visualizations (graphs) so that I can easily understand the findings.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

  * **Data Agnosticism:** The system must be able to analyze any type of tabular data (e.g., business, inventory, crime data) without being domain-specific.
  * **Data Resilience:** The platform must be engineered to gracefully handle common data quality issues, including broken/erroneous data, mismatched data types, and inconsistent formatting.

#### **3. System Architecture**

The system will be built using a service-oriented architecture, ideal for scalability and maintainability.

  * **React Frontend:** A Single-Page Application (SPA) that handles all user interaction, file uploads, and rendering of chat messages and charts (using a library like `Recharts` or `Chart.js`).
  * **Backend API Gateway (Python/FastAPI):** The central entry point for the frontend. It will manage user sessions, handle API requests, and route them to the appropriate backend services.
  * **Data Processing Service (Python):** This service activates upon file upload. It is responsible for ingesting, cleaning, standardizing, and structuring the data from user files into a queryable format in the database.
  * **AI Agent Service (Python):** The core intelligence. It receives natural language queries, orchestrates the generation and execution of analysis code, and synthesizes the final response.

#### **4. AI Agent: Detailed Design**

The AI Agent uses a **hybrid, agentic approach**, leveraging Google's Gemini models for code generation and analysis with intelligent fallback handling.

  * **Platform:** **Google Gemini API** with multi-model fallback system
  * **Model Hierarchy (Priority Order):**
      * **Primary:** `gemini-2.5-pro` - Most advanced thinking model for complex reasoning
      * **Fallback:** `gemini-2.5-flash` - Best price-performance model for high-volume tasks
      * **Tertiary:** `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` - Cost-efficient model for basic operations
  * **Multi-API Key Support:** Rotates through multiple API keys for enhanced reliability
  * **Automatic Model Switching:** Seamlessly falls back to next tier when limits are exceeded
  * **Execution Flow:**
    1.  **Schema Extraction:** Retrieves table schema and sample data for context
    2.  **Prompt Construction:** Builds detailed prompts with user query, schema, and instructions
    3.  **Model Selection:** Starts with Gemini 2.5 Pro, falls back automatically when needed
    4.  **Safe Code Execution:** Executes generated Python code in sandboxed environment
    5.  **Result Synthesis:** Generates natural language summaries with chart suggestions
    6.  **Chart Generation:** Creates interactive visualizations using Recharts

#### **5. Technology Stack Summary**

  * **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
  * **Backend:** Python (using FastAPI)
  * **Database:** SQLite (local development) / PostgreSQL (production)
  * **AI/LLM:** Google Gemini API (2.5 Pro â†’ 2.5 Flash â†’ 2.5 Flash-Lite)
  * **Deployment:** Railway (backend) / Vercel (frontend)

#### **6. Implemented Features & Enhancements**

**Core Functionality:**
  * **Modern UI/UX:** Responsive design with glass-morphism effects, gradients, and smooth animations
  * **Landing Page:** Professional welcome page with feature highlights and call-to-action
  * **File Upload:** Drag-and-drop interface with intelligent file processing
  * **Chat Interface:** Sidebar layout with session management and message history
  * **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts (bar, pie, line) with Recharts integration
  * **API Key Management:** Multi-key support with usage tracking and rotation

**Advanced Features:**
  * **Model Management:** Three-tier fallback system (Pro â†’ Flash â†’ Flash-Lite)
  * **Session Management:** Persistent chat sessions with context preservation
  * **Data Cleanup:** Comprehensive data clearing functionality
  * **Error Handling:** Robust error recovery and user feedback
  * **Mobile Responsive:** Optimized for all screen sizes and zoom levels
  * **Real-time Status:** Live model and API key status monitoring

**Technical Enhancements:**
  * **Enhanced Logging:** Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring
  * **Credit Tracking:** Detailed usage statistics and cost monitoring
  * **Security:** API key masking and secure data handling
  * **Performance:** Optimized for 90% zoom and efficient rendering
