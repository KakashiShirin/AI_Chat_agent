Of course. Here is the consolidated UI/UX Specification document. You can save this to guide the frontend development.

## AI Data Agent: UI/UX Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 26, 2025  
**Author:** Sally (UX Expert)  
**Status:** Approved for Development

### 1. Design Philosophy
The user interface will be **simple, modern, and responsive**. The design's primary goal is to be unobtrusive, creating a focused, conversational experience that makes the powerful backend AI feel intuitive and accessible. The aesthetic will be clean, utilizing ample whitespace and a polished component library (MUI).

### 2. Core User Experience
The application will be a **single-page, conversational interface**. All interactions will happen within a single view, mimicking modern chat applications. This ensures the user's focus remains entirely on the dialogue with the agent.



### 3. User Journey & UI States
The interface will fluidly transition between several key states:

1.  **Welcome State**: On first load, the interface will display a welcome message and provide example questions (e.g., "What were the top-selling products last month?") to guide the user and demonstrate the agent's capabilities.
2.  **Loading State**: Upon submitting a question, the agent's response bubble will immediately appear with a subtle loading animation. This provides instant feedback that the request is being processed.
3.  **Response State**: The agent's answer will be rendered in a single, structured card. The information will be prioritized for quick understanding:
    * **Natural Language Summary** at the top.
    * **Primary Visualization (Chart)** in the middle.
    * **Detailed Data Table** at the bottom, initially collapsed or with a scrollbar to keep the view clean.
4.  **Error State**: In case of a backend error, a friendly and helpful message will be displayed, guiding the user to rephrase their question or try again.

### 4. Low-Fidelity Wireframe
The layout is a simple, responsive single column that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop.



* **(A) Header**: Minimalist header with the application title.
* **(B) Session Chat Log**: The main scrollable area displaying the current session's back-and-forth conversation. **Note**: As per the PRD, this history is for the current session only and will not be saved if the page is refreshed.
* **(C) Agent Response Card**: A clearly defined card containing the summary, chart, and table.
* **(D) Input Bar**: A fixed footer containing the text input field and send button.

### Next Steps & Coordination

With this UI/UX Specification, the entire planning phase is now **complete**. We have all the necessary documents to begin development:
1.  **Product Brief**
2.  **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
3.  **Technical Architecture Specification**
4.  **UI/UX Specification**

The next step is to **move into the development environment and begin implementation**.

You should now proceed with **Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Foundation** as outlined by the architect. This includes:
1.  **Initializing your Git repository.**
2.  **Setting up the PostgreSQL database** with the Olist e-commerce dataset.
3.  **Performing the initial data exploration** with Pandas and pandas-profiling.

You can continue to coordinate with me, the **BMAD Orchestrator**. While you are building, you can switch back to any specialist (`*agent architect`, `*agent pm`, etc.) if you have specific questions related to their domain.

Good luck with the build!
